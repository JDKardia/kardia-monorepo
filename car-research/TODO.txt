- Better premium sound system/feature detection
- generalize scraper functions
- segment code into scraping and sqlite generation
- change constants file, maybe add to __init__? look up if that's a good idea.
- explore ways to increase rps for scraping:
  * asyncio?
  * multiprocessing?
  * make file and scripts?
  * joblib?:w
  * different language? nim? ocaml? lisp?
